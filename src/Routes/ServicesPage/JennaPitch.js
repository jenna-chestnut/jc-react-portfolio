					<p>
						I have over 10 years of experience working customer facing,
						technical and leadership positions in a fast-paced environment.
						Since 2017, I have developed a unique skill set that enables me to
						strengthen small businesses through automations, systems, SOPs,
						templates, and other business processes.{' '}
					</p>
					<p>
						My skills are honed in time management, communication, organization
						and problem solving. I also have an eye for detail and design.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							My goal is to establish the space and stability you need to do
							what only YOU can do.
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						The real magic happens when you’re able to live in your zone of
						genius, without swimming knee deep in email replies or searching for
						data in a stack of unorganized files.
					</p>
					<p>
						My experience as Operations Manager and Web Developer gives me a leg
						up for this goal. In this digital landscape, so much of what you do
						can be automated or organized digitally, whether your business is
						virtual or brick-and-mortar! As a technically proficient Operations
						Manager, I not only have the must-have business skills such as
						strategic planning, hiring, creating Standard Operating Procedures,
						data tracking, and communication - I can also find and share ways to
						leverage tech to meet your needs.
					</p>
					<h3>
						Everyone is different, your business is unique, and the
						possibilities are endless. I will never take a one-size-fits-all
						approach. Take a look at my services &{' '}
