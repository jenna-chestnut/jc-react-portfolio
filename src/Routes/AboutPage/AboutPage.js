										Since my first login, I've always had a penchant for
										navigating computer systems. The purposeful shift from
										restaurant industry to an administrative role in 2017 gave
										me the opportunity to further explore my tech skills, and
										fulfill my drive to improve the lives of others.

										As the go-to person for error messages, website tweaks and
										needed fixes when IT wasn't around, I knew that I wanted to
